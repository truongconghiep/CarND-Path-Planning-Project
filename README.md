## Introduction

In this project an algorithm for path planning will be implemented for an ego car in simulation environment to drive itself though a test track around 7 Km. Every 0.02 second the simulator provides car information and fusion information of other cars in the highway and take the generated trajactory to control the ego car.

## Code model

The path planning algorithm is implemented in three steps: vehicle prediction, behavior generation and trajectory generation.
